# RTS_4
3D RTS game in unity. UI Improvements from the engine I made with SDL(RTS_3). 

Download the Builds folder and run the .exe if you want to play what I've done so far.

Controls
---------

There is nothing wotng with the controls, as far as I know, but it takes a bit of getting used to because some of the actions are continuous and won't be overriden if your holding ctrl when you select the action. If in doubt look at the ActionInfo tab in the sidebar.

alt + rightmouse) tilt the camera

left click) select units and select menu items

right click) Open the PopMenu for giving an action to an entity

ctrl + leftclick) In the PopMenu ctrl + left click one of the options to queue actions, the action queue is shown in one of the side bar tabs
